# Music Genre Classification

This project aims to classify music genres using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imuhammad/audio-features-and-lyrics-of-spotify-songs/data.

## Project Structure

- `data_processing.ipynb`: This notebook contains the code for processing and cleaning the data. The cleaned data is saved as `spotify_songs_cleaned.csv`.
- `data_analyse.ipynb`: In this notebook I tried to find optimal solution.
- `final_model.ipynb`: This notebook contains the final model for music genre classification. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.0
2. Install the required Python packages.
3. Download the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imuhammad/audio-features-and-lyrics-of-spotify-songs/data).
4. Run the `data_processing.ipynb` notebook to process the data.
5. Run the `final_model.ipynb` notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Results

The final model achieved a macro average F1 score of 0.70 and a ROC-AUC score of 0.914.
